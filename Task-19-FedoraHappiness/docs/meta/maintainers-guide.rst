Guidelines for maintainers
##########################

These guidelines are intended for maintainers of fedora-happiness-packets (including Fedora Summer Coding mentors).
Following these guidelines helps us keep things running smoothly.
It also helps us when we are spread across different schedules and time zones.
Stick to these whenever possible.


*****************************************************
Use |PASSED| label to accept tickets for future work.
*****************************************************

The |PASSED| label indicates a ticket passed review by a maintainer.
This means it is accepted as a valid task to work on.
This label is useful during a summer coding application period.
Several people may look for tasks to work on.
Some new tickets may need consideration or triage before they are accepted.
This helps us avoid scope creep and doing too many things at once.

Remember our documentation states a person should only work on a ticket with the |PASSED| label.
Not using this label could exclude a ticket from consideration.


********************************************
Use tags to triage tickets for type of work.
********************************************

There are several tags for different types of tickets (e.g. ``type - docs``, ``type - frontend``, ``type-backend``, etc.).
Use these to triage types of work.
It is easier for contributors and maintainers:

-  Contributors can choose tasks in their interest areas
-  Maintainers can review changes in their skill area

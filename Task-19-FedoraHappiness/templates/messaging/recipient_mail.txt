Hello {{ message.recipient_name }}!

You've just received a Happiness Packet{% if message.sender_named %} from {{ message.sender_name }} ({{ message.sender_email }}){% endif %}!
{% if not message.sender_named %}The sender asked to remain anonymous.{% endif %}

If this is the first time you've heard about Happiness Packets, check out our website:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}/

In short, Happiness Packets are positivity messages that open-source contributors can send to each other
anonymously and confidentially. By sending Happiness Packets, we hope to create an atmosphere where
positive feedback is amplified and accepted more than negative feedback.

Your Happiness Packet contains:
---------------------
{{ message.message }}
---------------------

If you and the sender of the Happiness Packet both agree, we'd love to publish the message to our
Happiness Archive to inspire others from the community.

For this, please go to:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'messaging:recipient_message_update' identifier=message.identifier token=message.recipient_email_token %}

This is entirely optional, we respect your privacy and only publish messages if both the sender and recipient agree.

Have a happy day!

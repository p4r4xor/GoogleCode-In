# Calculus: Symbolic Mathematics using Python

### Symbolic computation

As the name says, its the computation with symbolic expressions. These may include computation of mathemaical equations, theorems or a plan situation. It just emphasizes term rewriting over evaluaion. Symbols are rewriteable terms, and are more abstract.

### Numeric computation

Emphasizes on finding the approximate solution of mathematical problems that cannot or need to be solved accurately. Often used for solving functions or a set of equaions, approximation and numerical integration.

### Basic differences

| Symbolic                   | Numeric                       |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| `Term rewriting over evaluation`            |      `Emphasizes for values`     |
| `More abstract`   | `More concrete`       |
| `Rewriteable expressions`  | `Loss of precision`    |

## Comments over sympy and scipy:

sympy is for symbolic math, i.e. working with algebra/formulas. numpy and scipy are for working with actual data. If we're doing data analysis we want to use numpy and scipy. If we're doing theoretical math/physics, we consider sympy.

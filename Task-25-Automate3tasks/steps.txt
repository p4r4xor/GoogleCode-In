To run the code, "python3.7 Automate3tasks.py"

WARNING: (current findings for now) 

0)If your cronjob involves GUI apps, we need to tell which DISPlAY to use. "export DISPLAY=:0" works fine.
1)Please have your timezone set on your linux correctly. Wasted a lot of time on this.
2)Make sure there is a newline after you edit a crontab file.
3)If cron daemon doesn't run, please follow the sub steps.

** pgrep cron
-- If you see no number, then cron is not running. sudo /etc/init.d/cron start can be used to start cron.

** sudo service cron restart / sudo systemctl start cron

4)Make the script executable beforehand.

Steps:

I've followed some of the steps in the URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24518522/run-python-script-at-startup-in-ubuntu

1)My timezone was wrong, corrected with "sudo service cron restart"

2)sudo cp -i ~/Downloads/GCI-fedora/Automate3tasks/code.py /bin

3)sudo crontab -e

4)* * * * * export DISPLAY=:0 && @reboot python /bin/test_code.py &

5)And you're done :)

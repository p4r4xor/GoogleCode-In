# Tensorflow
TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google and has become very popular with Machine Learning. TensorFlow offers APIs that facilitates Machine Learning. TensorFlow also has a faster compilation time than other Deep Learning libraries such as Keras and Touch. TensorFlow supports both CPU and GPU computing devices.

It was originally developed to run large numerical computations which makes it a great tool for Deep Learning. It accepts data in the form of multidimensional arrays called Tensors. This application lends itself to handling large amounts of data. The execution mechanism is in the form of graphs so that makes it easier to execute the code.

This is a neural network. There is an input and outer layer and a bunch of hidden layers. Typically, there is only one hidden layer. If there is more than one, it is known as a deep neural network. The input layer accepts large amounts of data as input to build the network. It then passes that data to the hidden layer(s) where the data is processed by performing complex operations and feature extraction is carried out. The training occurs in the hidden layer(s). It is then passed to the outer layer which translates it into output format.

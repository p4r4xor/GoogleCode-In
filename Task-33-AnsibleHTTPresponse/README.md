# Ansible HTTP response
What are response codes? Well, These are made when someone makes a request to the webserver. And it's 3 digits. :v 

These are divided into 5 categories:
* `100-199` - Information responses
* `200-299` - Successful responses
* `300-399` - Redirects
* `400-499` - Client errors
* `500-599` - Server errors

Yo did I just explain everything?

Examples:

`Self explanatory means the title itself has your required answer`

* `200 OK`                        - Webpage is presented, without any trouble
* `301 Moved Permanently`         - Self explanatory
* `302 Found (Moved Temporarily)` - Redirected to a new URL
* `403 Forbidden`                 - You don't have the permissions to view the site.
* `404 Not found`                 - Self explanatory
* `500 Internal Server Error`     - Nothing is received. Self explanatory
* `503 Service Unavailable`       - Self explanatory

### Introduction.
Hello everyone! I’m paraxor, a student at GEMS United Indian School (GUIS) participating from the United Arab Emirates. The year 2019 was awesome considering my participation in the Google Code-In, and the year I’ve learnt to code. The organization I’ve taken part is The Fedora Project.

### What's this?

This repo is a collective of all the tasks done by me for the Fedora Project Organization. I've done a total of 76 tasks, which included a lot of writing code, Documentation, Research, Design and Quality assurance. The repo isn't sorted, sorry for it.

### My Journey.
I've documented my journey as a series of Medium stories (which've been a huge success) and they're attached below.

WHOIS is a lookup service administered by various domain-name registrars who must provide free access (via a website and programmatically) to domain name registration data. In theory, the WHOIS protocol exposes a standard interface for retrieving information associated with a particular domain name.

### What information can I find in the WHOIS?

Even though for most domains details about the owner are hidden, you can still find useful information in the WHOIS. You can see when the domain will expire, what the transfer status is, who the registrar is for the domain, who to contact in case of abuse, and what name servers are being used.

If you want to look up information on a domain, you can use our WHOIS Lookup page. Here you can also fill out a form to contact the owner of any domain that is hosted with us. Of course, it's up to the owner to decide if they want to respond to your inquiry.

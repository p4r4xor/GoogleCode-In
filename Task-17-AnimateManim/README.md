# Animate Manim
 
 I've used manim to create a short simulation of a high-school topic. 
 
 ### Requirements
 
 ```
    git clone https://github.com/3b1b/manim.git
    pip3 install manim numpy
    sudo apt install ffmpeg sox
    sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev
    sudo apt install texlive-latex-base texlive-full texlive-fonts-extra
 ```
 
 ### Usage
 
 Go to the `manim` directory and place your required files for animation in the same.
 
 General command to run manim projects:
 ```
    python3 -m manim YourPythonCode.py --high_quality
 ```
 
 I had only one `class`, so it didn't prompt me any.

# Codeforces Contest Registration

This is an automation task which requires selenium. This is really helpful for saving time on accessing codeforces to register for contests.

You can change the option to headless mode manually if you're really confident of my code :)

### Usage
```
python3.7 CodeforcesRegistration.py
```

### Requirements
```
pip3 install selenium
```
